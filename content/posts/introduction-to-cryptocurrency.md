A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that can be exchanged online. It resides on online ledgers and are protected by strong cryptography and circulates on a system called the **Blockchain**.

Blockchain is a decentralized technology, meaning, there is no central entity that controls and regulates it contrary

to the fiat currencies like US dollars and Euros that is being controlled by the banking systems and institutions.

## What are they for?

Cryptocurrencies are used to buy goods and services. Various cryptocurrencies has various use-cases and depends on the ecosystem that built them. They have different purposes, uses, strengths and weaknesses.

In general, cryptocurrencies can be used internationally without the element of border control. They can be sent to anyone with a crypto wallet via the internet without the worry of different nationality or country currencies. 

## Can they be Exchanged to Cash?

Cryptocurrencies can be traded in various currencies, both fiats and cryptos. If they are in the form of fiat currency, then they can be exchanged in a physical money. Although this may be convenient for others, what is more convenient is the direct use of cryptos in buying commodities. This will be a game changer for a lot of people and they are already happening!

## Why is Cryptocurrency Created?

The first cryptocurrency is **Bitcoin**. It was created for the people to be able to exchange or send money anywhere without the need for a central controlling system. To be treated as traditional money, but more open and more transparent.

According to the entity behind Bitcoin, in the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, "The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust thatâ€™s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.". This must be the main reason why the first cryptocurrency was created in the first place.

## Is Crypto Safe?

Cryptos are backed by strong cryptography, in the case of Bitcoin, it was SHA-256 algorithm. It was developed by the the US NSA. Breaking this would be impossible as it is said that there are more possible keys in this algorithm (22<sup>56</sup>) than all the atoms in the universe<sup>[2]</sup>.

## Crypto Privacy

Bitcoin is very private. Even though a transaction is logged publicly, the person or entity that made the transaction remains anonymous. The name and location of the transacting parties are unknown, only the wallet address. This anonymity sadly became advantageous to other people. This was famous in the transaction of underground dealings that the governments cannot track.

But even though it was used in bad applications, there are more than use cases for the betterment of life and for our advantage. I suggest we find those uses and benefit from them for good.
