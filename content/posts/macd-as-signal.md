MACD or Moving Average Convergence Divergence, is an indicator that is placed at the bottom of the chart. It is a combination of moving average lines called the MACD, Signal and also the Histogram.

The indicator looks like this

Tap on the image to zoom in. The indicator above has the default values set in binance. 

What we want to focus here are these four elements:

The MACD, Signal, Zero line and the Histogram. The Zero line here is our basis for SOR (Sign of reversal). This is where we establish the signals for buying and selling.

Note that the zero line here is not really a line, but an invisble line. It's the upper base or lower base of our histogram.

What we want to look for is the SOR. If we are looking for a buying signal, we want to see that the blue line crosses the red line and that the blue line goes over. Notice that the histogram also changes its position from below the zero line to above. This is where it intersects the zero line and this is our good indicator for buying or placing a long position.

Now inversely, if we want to look for signal in selling, just watch for the opposite, look for the time where the blue line crosses the red line and goes under it. This is where the histogram also changes its position.

One more thing to remember. For this to be effective, make sure that the candlestick at this position is bullish when your buying and bearish when your selling.

So that's it for now. Thanks for reading and happy trading!
