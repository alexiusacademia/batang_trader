## Introduction

A lot of people have already gained ond lost a lot of money through trading, maybe directly or indirectly. However, can we really earn money or invest in trading without worrying about losing our hard earned savings? The answer to that is absolutely yes. 

<!-- more -->

Some people say that "People fear what they don't understand.". This is definitely true. A lot of people are afraid and hesitant to trading, especially Stocks and FOREX trading as this needs a broker or a middle man before you can start, making them harder to start for begginers.

## Trading Cryptocurrency

I mentioned that in stocks and FOREX trading, there are middlewares who is represented by individuals or companies, in cryptotrading, you only need the platform to start investing. Most of cryptocurrency exchanges handles what the broker is supposed to do like placing your buy or sell.

In crypto trading, we just need our capital, open an account to an exchange, fund it and start the trading. Simple as that.

Trading cryptocurrency can be financially fulfilling if done correctly and with proper planning. Line actions, carefully planned and with clear goals can get as where we want to go. Same in trading, whether is for cryptocurrency, stocks and foreign currencies.

## Is it Hard to Start?

Starting the trading with virtual currency is not that hard. It's simple actually. What you just need is some capital that you're willing to invest, opening an account to an exchange and learn how to buy and sell cryptos. 

Opening an account may require some sort of identity verification. This will be used in verifying during the funding and withrawal process to secure your account. Security is very important here as we are moving our earned money and we don't want those go to waste.

## Is Trading Risky?

In a way, yes. But only if we it want to be risky. Trading of bitcoin and other altcoins are relatively easy and profitability for everyone. For the SPOT trading, it's not risky. You'll only lose your money if the coin that you bought becomes nothing. This is why we shall make some research first to know what coin (crypto) we buy and hold if we want to go for long term investment.

With the right setup and readiness of our mindset, I can assure you that crypto trading is not risky at all. With some guidance, a beginner can absolutely benefit even for the start. That is why I don't recommend experimenting at first at the start. This is what I did as there is no one to guide me. I learned the hard way by losing and freezing some of my asset while waiting to be sold. In this website, batangtrader, you can ask the author about guidance in getting started to trade. This way, you'll eliminate the risk of losing or freezing your assets as I have experienced in my beginning of trade.

I was so desperate to learn and didn't bother to read full papers or books in trading, for me experience is the best teacher. I used money that I can lose so that I cannot be carried out by emotion when losing, this way, I learned a lot like reading charts, knowing where to invest and where not to. I learned staking, trading with margin and futures by experimenting and practice. And then lost some of my money. But then I learned how to do them properly. That's why I'm sharing this to you and that you don't have to go down that path without a guide. That is a mistake that I learned from.

## How Much Do I Need?

Well you don't really need money for trading if you don't want to. The wuestion here must be, "How much should I invest to earn?". We'll explain it this way:

> Trading is simply "Buy and Sell". We buy a commodity at a certain price and then we sell it at a higher price and make profit. The more we buy and sell, the more profit we make.

This is just what we should always remember. Trading is Buy and Sell. If we want to earn more, we should invest more. This way, we eliminate the risks. Trading with a large percentage of profit against the capital is possible, but they have the risks. Big risks.

If we want to go to safe path, we just remember this, the larger the capital, the larger the gains. 

At first, you can have small percentage of profits in trading just to gain knowledge about the subject and feel it. We can set an earning of about 0.5% to 1% for each day. And then if we feel that we are getting better at reading the trends and predicting price movements, we move to 3% a day, and then 5% and then 10% and so on. The largest easy trade I got is around 15% in one day after all the practices and experiences I had. You can also do this. 

For starters, I suggested to my colleagues and friends to start at around **$75** to **$100**. And then I helped them get started with a platform/exchange. With this small start-up fund, you can begin learning how to trade, experience the charts and learn the trends and how they move. You'll gain knowledge and confidence in the process. With consistent plan and set of goals, you'll definitely make your money work for you.

## Is it Profitable?

Yes it is. As long as we don't make trading as gamble we're good. We eleminate the risks if we stay away from gamble-style trading. By learning to read charts, analyzing the trend and disciplining ours mind, we can definitely make profit from trading.

In the next articles that I will publish, I may present some data taken from real profits in trading, you'll how much in percent per day is possible with little starting funds and how much it could be if you're investing more.

## How to Start?

To start, we first choose a platform. I recommend Binance as this is what I have been using so far alongside Bittrex and CEX.IO. It's easy to use and have great tools in our disposal with intuitive user interface.

First, let's make you an account. You'll find below a referral link of mine. I recommend using a referral link like below as they give you discounts in every transaction you'll make. Mine here is 5% for the user (that's you). At the time of this writing, each transaction at binance costs 0.1%. That means your transaction fee for any trade will be 0.095%.

After registering to Binance, next step is the verification. Each account shall be verified before starting to put funds in your account. This way, Binance protects our money from anyone. Verification is simple. Just follow the instructions by preparing your identification card. In my case, driver's license is the easiest one to be approved. So far, approval just ranges in minutes.

After verification, you can now start putting your starting fund in your account. Easiest way is to use credit or debit card. However, I find that using the app Coins.ph is better because of lesser fees.

That's it and see you in the next article. Happy trading and good luck!
