In this entry, we'll be looking at the behavior instead of the technical side of day trading. I just want to talk a little bit about this as this brings so much importance in the trading world.

In combining proper discipline and fundamental understanding of this area, I belive we have a higher chance of taking advantage on the price volatility of cryptos. 

## Day Trader

One of the types of traders is a **Day Trader**. Day traders are those that buys and sells within a day. Exploiting price movements within 24 hours and not leaving an open trade overnight. This tends to have a lot more trades or transaction compared to Swing Trading *(another type of trading)*.


## 2 Categories of Traders

If we look closely, we can tell that there are these two traders. The one that rides the market and the one that dictates it.

As beginners and doesn't have that much capital, we may be in the area of those that ride the trend. A big mistake of people is to think that they are on the dictating side. Hold on tight and let's chunk this out.

### Dictators

Traders that have dictating powers are those with big capitals like large companies/corporations. Or others that are really have enough money to disrupt or control a trend, making those u-turn of the trendline.

I say dictators, not because they directly communicate with us, but because they let us think that the market trend is going the way they want. And it works, well most of the time.


### Riders

Riders goes in a different direction. If dictators makes the trend, riders ride the trend. 

They go along no matter where the trend is going, it maybe uptrend or downtrend, it doesn't matter. They still make profits by taking advantage of price volatility of a crypto inside a trend.

I for one, consider myself as a rider. It doesn't matter if the market is high or low, I still make my trade. 


## Conclusion

The main purpose of knowing what kind of trader we are is to make sure we left no positions unintended. This creates a bit of a problem especially for those that has very limited buying capacity. Don't ever think that you control a trend, and by buying an asset makes it goes up in price if you are a rider. We just ride along if we are. Well whoever knows, maybe someday, we get to experience the other one.


  

Thank you for reading. Happy trading and trade wisely!
