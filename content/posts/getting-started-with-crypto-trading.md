## Introduction

In general, I will be talking about the [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=W77T00WI) platform in this post. I may mention other exchange platforms but not be in detail. 

Getting started with crypto trading is not that hard. To get started in registration, please read my previous article [here](https://batangtrader.com/2021/08/21/trading-in-crypto/). In that post, you will learn about the basics of crypto trading like which platforms are available and how much for starter you may need.

In this post, you will learn about getting started with the platform like depositing your fund for your wallet, how to withraw from Binance, what is HODL about and a few more, so let's gets started.

<!-- more -->


## Selecting an Exchange

As I mentioned above, there are other available exchanges other than Binance. There's also Bittrex and CEX.IO. However, I find the Binance platform more user friendly, intuitive and has a lot of tools. 

The thing that set the CEX.IO from the two (2) is it's easy to withraw from the platform. You can just link your debit card and withraw to it directly. On the other hand, Bittrex has an upside too. 

Now I must say this at the earliest time, each transaction on cryptocurrency like trading or sending to other people come at a cost (transaction fee). In Binance, each transaction costs 0.1% of the transaction amount. In Bittrex, there is what they call _Bittrex Credits_. You can earn credits for each transaction and these credits can be used for the transaction fees. So that's basically free transaction fee. However, there are cryptos listed on Binance but not on Bittrex.

For starter, I still recommend Binance. It's easier to use than the other two.


## Depositing For Investment

From here on, I will only refer to Binance each time I am referring to an exchange.

Binance is working hard I must say in adding various ways of cashing in and out in their platform. I will explain here the few that are easy and I recommend for beginners.

Now before that, I shall mention that you must select a stable cryptocurrency when buying. Stable currency is what most of us used in buying and selling. This will be your base currency although not that restricted. It's just for conventional method and convenience in calculating profits. In my case, I use `USDT` coin. When I buy, that's what I buy. Not directly buying `Bitcoin` or any coins other than `USDT`. `USDT` is a theter, it corresponds to US Dollar so that is a good currency for use as a baseline.

### 1. P2P

P2P means Peer to Peer or person directly with another person. Basically, you are dealing with another person from Binance in buying or selling a cryptocurrency.

![p2p Menu](/static/p2p_menu.png) 

By clicking _P2P Trading_, you will have a page something like this:

![p2p display](/static/p2p_display.png)

<br><br>

In this case, I have already filtered the result with the following parameters:

```
Fiat = PHP
Payment = GCash
```

I used GCash in this example since this is frequently used here in the Philippines but there are still a lot of options available.

Now if you click the <button style="padding: 5px; background-color: #6ade89; color: white; border-radius: 2px; border: none;">Buy USDT</button> button, you will be redirected to the buy page. Just input the amount and follow the instructions. In the end, you have to trust the seller and send him/her the payment first thru GCash wallet and upload the confirmation page from GCash to the chat area provided in the page of the Binance P2P. Then you have to verify that the transfer has been made.

In my experience, I have not encountered a problem so far using this method. Most of the sellers are responsive in the chat room provided. The only downside is the mark-up they put on the price of the coin you are buying. The lesser the minimum amount of buy is, the higher the price they are offering.


### 2. Credit/Debit Card

Now this is the easiest way in cashing-in funds. Here's how you do it, just go to Buy Crypto and then select `Credit/Debit Card`.

![card menu](/static/card_menu.png)

And then you will have a page showing something like this

![card buy](/static/card_buy.png)

Just input the amount you want to spend. Select the currency you want to use. And then in the `Receive` area, select `USDT` as the currency as shown above. Then click continue. 

Note that while you're typing in the _spend_ input, you will find that the _receive_ input is automatically calculated. This is done by converting the amount you typed with the current conversion rate. However, don't expect that the amount you see in the receive section is the same amount you will actually receive, this is because of the transaction fee. It may be reduced or you card may be charged more than what you input. Notice the price displayed in that page will be different in the price when you will actually buy the coint.

Just click `Continue` and then `Continue` again in the next page. If you haven't set-up a card yet, here is where you might do that while buying. The steps is fairly simple to follow.


### 3. Using Coins.ph

Then for the last one that I recommend, remember I mentioned that we should buy cryptos that are stable while funding our wallet right? Well this case is an exception. The reason for this is to make sure that the transaction fees is put to the minimum. Meaning this is most effient among the three when considering prices and amount to receive.

I will not go into detail by posting images about this section but the process is all you need.

1. First, download the _Coins.ph_ app.
2. Create an account and do the verifications atleast for the first 2 levels. Level 3 gives you more flexibility by giving you a cash-in limit of Php400,000.00 and not cash-out limit.
3. Fund your coins.ph account using bank transfer or using other e-wallets.
4. When you have PHP already in your coins.ph and ready to fund Binance using it, convert this PHP to XRP coin inside coins.ph. 
5. Go to your binance account and go to your wallet and click deposit. In the deposit crypto, select XRP coin and select the `XRP` for the network. Remember that you must select the correct network or your money will be lost. In this case it's `XRP` network.
6. If the address is not shown or blurred, just click the show address.
7. Take note or copy both the address and the MEMO number. 
8. Now go back to your coins.ph app and to the XRP tab. 
9. Tap Send then select `Enter XRP Address`
10. Now paste in the address from binance in the XRP Address input and paste the MEMO from binance in the Destination Tag.
11. Confirm the transaction and wait for Binance to confirm your deposit. This may take a few seconds or one minute. 

Sending through XRP network is very fast compared to others. Now the reason why we choose this method is that you only have to worry about the conversion from PHP (Peso) to XRP which is of course have charge or mark-up. Then when sending from Coins.ph to Binance, it only costs `0.000045 XRP` or about 15 pesos at the time of this writing.

You can find that using Coins.ph is better in regard to charges compared to the other two.


## Withrawal

Withrawal from Binance is a little bit hard when you compare it to CEX.IO. As I have mentioned, you can withraw from CEX.IO directly to your debit card which is very convenient for us. However, in Binance, you have the option of the P2P and the Withraw from wallet feature. In the P2P, that's almost the same as when buying crypto so you just have to follow the steps you did when you make deposit using crypto. However, as the XRP transfer is cheap, this is what I have been using and this is what I recommend.

When withrawing using XRP, I still use Coins.ph as it can be connected to your bank account and other e-wallets and it is most convenient for me.

To withraw funds, convert your fund to XRP coin. Then use the wallet address and destination tag in Coins.ph to be feed on Binance withraw form. Make sure that the network is XRP so that your money woun't be lost.


## HODL

HODL is just a term used in the crypto world and just means to hold your asset for a long period of time until you decide to sell it at your selected price range. This may refer to both long term and short term traders.


## Selecting the Good Time to Buy and to Sell

Now this may be an interesting part of this post and have extention for a more broad and separate articles in this website. 

Knowing the time for you to buy and to sell maximizes your chance of getting profit on your desired time. One of the reason why setting goal is important (see section below).

If your target is to have a specific amount or percentage of profit in a regular basis, setting goal is very important for you. As begginers, I suggest you follow the section below for the daily goals or scale them accordingly based on your capital.

The main thing we shall remember is that, if we buy a certain asset or crypto, we shall only sell it at the price higher than our buy price. This ensure our profit. Never ever panic to sell especially if you have bought known coins in the market worrying that it may never go up.

The best time to buy is really the time when the market is down. Following news and articles in the internet about cryptocurrencies is a good way of finding out if the market is down. However, on Binance, you can already learn about it by following the chart of a certain crypto. Make sure you are viewing it on a longer candle time frame like 1-hour. This gives you an idea if the trend is going down (bearish).

The main advantage of crypto is it's volatility, so that's where we can come in. We take advantage of it's price fluctuations buy buying the lows and selling at certain amount of profit. If we do this consistently, we ensure that our goal is met and our target profit achieved.


## Technical Analysis

On binance, certain classical patterns can be viewed at the page with the link below.

[Classical Chart Patterns](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-classical-chart-patterns)

Technical analysis is the analysis of the price trend by using the available tools in Binance or other platforms. These tools are the charts, candle sticks inside the chart, drawing tools and indicators. On the above link, various known patterns are introduced to give the readers familiarity on the known chart patterns developed and observed by old time and expert traders.

I may create a separate article regarding the technical analysis and the right time for buying and selling but for now, you can use this basic information about them.

## Setting Goals

Let's talk about goals in this section. For the times when the market is moving against what we expect, we should always be ready. Let's always have fund left to buy for the opportunities that we may miss.

Let's say for example you think that the trend is going up, and then you buy with all the fund in your wallet, but then the market goes down unexpected. Now that your money hangs in there, waiting for that market to go up, you are missing some opportunities. Opportunities to buy at lower prices. Your missing the time that you shall be making profit right?

I will be talking about setting goal here as small profit goal. Like daily or weekly goals. As long as it is consistent, even with small amounts, we can still continuously make profit.

Let's say for example, for a month, you want to make a profit of 8%. We then split this into 4 weeks, and that's 2% profit of what is in our wallet per week. Now let's break it down even further if you want to make it in days. Let's say we only want to trade daily on days except sunday, so that's 6 days in a week. Let's divide that 2% in 6 and that's around 0.33%. Let's say at the start we have $100.00. Setting the profit for 0.33% is easy, we just have to make a profit of $0.33 per day right?

Let's have a look at the computation below:

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>Goal(monthly)</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mn>8%</mn>
</math>
<br>
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>Goal(weekly)</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mn>2%</mn>
</math>

| Day | Fund | Sale | Profit | Profit (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100 | 100.33 | 0.33 | 0.33 |
| 2 | 100.33 | 100.66 | 0.33 | 0.33 |
| 3 | 100.66 | 100.99 | 0.33 | 0.33 |
| 4 | 100.99 | 101.33 | 0.33 | 0.33 |
| 5 | 101.33 | 101.66 | 0.33 | 0.33 |
| 6 | 101.66 | 102.00 | 0.33 | 0.33 |

At the end of the week we'll have 

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>Profit</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mn>$2.0</mn>
</math>

<br>

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
    <mi>Profit (%)</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <mn>2% of the $100.00</mn>
</math>

<br>
<br>

And then if we carry with that for the second week, with the fund of `$102.0`, we'll roughly get `$104.04`. If we continue that until the end of fourth week, we can achieve `$108.24`, and that's `8.24%`!

Remember that you may find it sometimes that more than `0.33%` is doable in a day and it really is. We're just limiting it here in this tutorial for conservative reason and larger chance of return almost every single time.


## Final Remarks

Trading is fun. Especially when you track your activities and see that you are actually gaining profit from it. Trading can also be frustrating if you continually lost or not gaining any profit in a few days. But this is part of it. Belonging to a group of traders can help a lot. You may share insights and opinions about your experiences that can absolutely change the way you do trading. 

Another final thought and reminders. Patience, discipline and study. These are your internal tools that can help you succeed in trading. Thanks for reading and goodluck! See you on the next articles.
