Late last night, we observed a large bearish move of bitcoin. A 24 hour change of more than 10%!

This brings a lot of talks about what is happening in the market after it's been going at around `$46k` to `$52k` in the past few days. At one point during the sell-off, bitcoin has reached down to `$42.8k`!

During this bearish movement, the market has recorded about `$3 Billion` in liquidation according to [bybt](https://bybt.com). This came from 375,030 traders in the last 24 hours.

This may be a good correction for the crypto ecosystem.

All cryptocurrencies following bitcoin almost experienced the red times.

However, it can also be noted that bitcoin is now a legal tender in the country El Salvador. Alongside US Dollar, bitcoin is now added as their national currency.

With this bitcoin crash, the President, Nayib Bukele tweeted that he is "buying the dip".

So let's say that the president really does that, What would you think will the countrymen will do? Are they going to follow and buy bitcoin during the dip? 

What happens if a whole country buys a cryptocurrency? Please comment below. Thanks for reading and happy trading!
